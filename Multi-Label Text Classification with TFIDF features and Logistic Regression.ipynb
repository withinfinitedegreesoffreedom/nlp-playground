    "# Multi-Label Text Classification with TFIDF features and Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, I have implemented a Logistic Regression model for multi-label classification using TfIdf features extracted from text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the TFIDF vectorization is a very sparse matrix, linear classifiers are known to work well with them. Also the available data and the number of features extracted from them can although be large, linear methods can use them to train a model. \n",
    "\n",
    "I have therefore made the choice to use a Logistic regression model. \n",
    "\n",
    "I use a combination of main_product names and sub_product names as the tags after doing a number of text cleaning steps. "
