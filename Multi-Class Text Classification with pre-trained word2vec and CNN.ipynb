    "\n",
    "I use the pre-trained word2vec embeddings to generate the tokens from the text \n",
    "\n",
    "I then apply 1D convolutions of varying kernel sizes on the tokenized text to combine the pre-trained embeddings from word2vec which can help discover useful patterns in text. \n",

    "- Plenty of data is available for training a NN\n",
    "- An attempt to train end-to-end and not worry about feature engineering\n",
    "- To use feature vectors of low dimensions such as 300 in this example vs. a few 100k features as in TfIdf vectorization\n",
    "- Curious how CNNs will learn the spatial depedency in the text\n"
